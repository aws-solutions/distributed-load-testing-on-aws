    - <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62714281/http-2-request-with-jmeter-fails-with-nullsession-jetty-alpn>
    - <https://webtide.com/jetty-alpn-java-8u252/>
    - See the latest `jetty-*.jar` files in the [Maven repository](https://mvnrepository.com/):
      - [jetty-alpn-client](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.eclipse.jetty/jetty-alpn-client)
      - [jetty-alpn-openjdk8-client](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.eclipse.jetty/jetty-alpn-openjdk8-client)
